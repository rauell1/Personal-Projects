#Imagine that your computer program loves these plants. 
# Whenever it receives an input in the form of the word Spathiphyllum, it involuntarily shouts to the console the following string: 
# "Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!"

#Write a program that utilizes the concept of conditional execution, takes a string as input, and:

#prints the sentence "Yes - Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!" to the screen if the inputted string is "Spathiphyllum" (upper-case)
#prints "No, I want a big Spathiphyllum!" if the inputted string is "spathiphyllum" (lower-case)
#prints "Spathiphyllum! Not [input]!" otherwise. Note: [input] is the string taken as input.
#Test your code using the data we've provided for you. And get yourself a Spathiphyllum, too!



user_input = str(input("Write something: "))


if user_input == "Spathiphyllum":
    print("Yes - Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!")

elif user_input == "spathiphyllum":
    print("No, I want a big Spathiphyllum!")
else:
    print("Input Spathiphyllum! Not ", user_input)
